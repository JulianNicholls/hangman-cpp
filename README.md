# Hangman in C++

My goto project when I'm learning a new language. Actually, I learnt C++ over 30 years ago, 
but C++ and I have moved on a lot in that time.

So, here in 2025, I'm learning C++20 (it would be C++23, but I'm on a Mac with XCode not 
even supporting all of C++20).

I'm embracing the old and the new:

Tmux - I've tried to get into this a few times, but I now have a real handle on it.
NeoVim - I learnt vi more than 40 years ago, but NeoVim has re-ignited my interest.
Lazygit - What a great Git front-end.
